## About:
This is an implementation of a convolutional neural network using pytorch and trained on the mnist image dataset for character recognition.

## Requirements:
- pytorch v X.X
- numpy v X.X
- python v3.6

## Algorithm:
Convolutional neural networks are based on mamalian visual cortex, extracting geometric features from each layer in what is comparable to a discrete convolution operation. This algorithm has lead to massive leaps in computer vision forever changing the field of deep learning and machine learning.

## Data:
The data used to test this implementation is MNIST written character dataset.

- MNIST IMAGE SAMPLES

Each image is a 28 by 28 greyscale digit from 0-9. 

## Training:
The model is trained using stochastic gradient descent to minimize the error from the mean squared error objective function. As you can see from the graph the loss steadily declines and early stoping is employed when the model validation loss begins to deviate too drasticly from the training loss.

## Results:
- show end result accuracy 
- show prediction plot
- include closing thoughts + improvements

## Sources:
- MNIST Dataset 
- Convolutional NN paper Yann LeCun
